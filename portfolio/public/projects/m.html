<p>After seeing multiple online product configurators, I wanted to explore the usage of WebGL to address some weaknesses I discovered. 
Once the model is loaded, textures, materiality, colors and configurations could be switched on the fly.</p>
<p>The object could also be magnified without having to load further resources. As object I chose the M240 
rangefinder camera from Leica Camera AG, as it posed a good mix of simple and complex modeling tasks. 
The model was done in blender, and loaded with three.js. </p>
<p><strong>Please note</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To view the examples, you need a browser capable of rendering WebGL (Chrome / Safari / Firefox / IE11)</li>
<li>This was done in a blender course at the Zurich University of the Arts and is not related to my internship at Leica Camera AG</li>
<li>The motorola motomaker now uses webGL for the configurator. <a href="www.motorola.com/us/motomaker">Nice!</a></li>
</ul>
