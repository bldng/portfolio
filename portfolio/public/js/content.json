They are loosely based on scenes and transcribed with fragments from &quot;The Street&quot; by Georges Perec.</em></p>\n<p>Simultaneously to the increasing measures of &quot;traditional&quot; public surveillance such as cameras, clickers and wiretapping, the technical capabilities of ubiquitous computing devices rise to a an alarming level of detail. Concurrent, following Moore&#39;s Law [1] - which states that the number of transistors fitting on a circuit the same size approximately doubles every two years - this trend is not going to end soon. For example, in the year 2011, ten percent of all photos <em>ever</em> taken were generated [2].</p>\n<p>This scientific progress has two points that I want to discuss, first - a few thoughts on how the technically advanced surveillance mechanisms differ from the traditional ones - and the second is a view on monitoring <em>enthusiasts</em>. </p>\n<p>In a first draft, I wanted to contemplate the idea of a general exaggeration of digital surveillance, especially under the aspect of willingly generated data. But, as a young fellow then uncovered, the wet dreams of conspiracy theorists became reality. As it seems likely there is even more to be revealed, I try to carefully bypass the elephant in the room. But, what stays is the difference in the character of the digital surveillance. By now, the omnipresent cameras are a well known and mundane phenomenon, while we certainly don&#39;t see all of them, we assume that, as soon as we enter the public space we are filmed. Or, as Foucault said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>He who is subjected to a field of visibility, and who knows it, assumes responsibility for the constraints of power; he makes them play spontaneously upon himself; he inscribes in himself the power relation in which he simultaneously plays both roles; he becomes the principle of his own subjection. [3]</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The internalisation of power shapes what we do and what we don&#39;t do in a public space, just by assuming that somebody watches and judges, with potential consequences for the actor. Now, the increased usage of cell phones, smart phones and GPS devices allows for a precise tracking without the actor knowing or even assuming. Other than the unverifiability of being watched by a supervisor in a panopticon-like surrounding, the majority of people are not even aware, thus do not convey the power structure or change their behavior, which is seen as main reasoning in the installation of public surveillance mechanisms. \nOther than with the modern highlights of urban coexistence, like Business Improvement Districts, where the surveillance obviously serves the purpose of filtering out individuals that can not or do not want to participate in the consumption, the digital surveillance does not specify a target group you can easily exclude yourself from. You could always easily say that an installed camera is not installed for you, but for vandals, criminals or whatever marginal group you don&#39;t want to categorize yourself under. But with governments and corporations blurring the distinction between public and private areas while advancing in more and more intimate aspects it gets harder to exclude yourself rhetorically.</p>\n<p>Of course, the unknown surveillance methods aren&#39;t exclusively bound to new technologies, which the example of the german dragnet investigation of 1979 shows. To find a conspirative flat used by the Red Army Faction, the investigators came to the conclusion that the terrorists had to pay their electricity bill in cash. So they filtered the cash payers out of the database stored on a magnet tape, applied a few more filters like car owners until only two entries were left, a drug dealer and the wanted terrorist. </p>\n<p>But, this was - besides trying to spot benefit cheats later on - an isolated case accompanied with lots of manual work and targeted planning and again, you could easily exclude yourself, not being a subaltern.\nWith the adoption of newer technologies it is now possible without hard work and specific intention to accumulate vast amounts of of data, while the focus of the surveillance shifts from visibility to traceability. And this is not something that will start to decline, as the economy acquired a taste of it - the same patterns and services can be employed for the detection of fraudulent behavior and the optimization of target group specific direct mailings. Both operating and potentially profitable without the monitored individuals knowing. Apparently, the possible benefit and monetization provoked a massive compulsive data hoarding trend, especially for facebook and other big social networks, which ultimately governments wanted to take part in.\nBut most importantly, the mentioned uncertainty of constantly being monitored, with the advances to more and more private areas, contains the question of what you are supposed to do altogether. An interesting approach in my opinion is the project of Kenneth Michael Merrill [4] who has made himself a publicly owned company, effectively letting shareholders define the relevant decisions of the further progress of his life, even for personal relationships, assuming that when the shareholders have flesh in the game, they are likely to make a decision with a well-thought beneficial outcome. In June, the shareholders for example agreed on a &quot;General Relationship Agreement&quot;, where he defined the character in various details. </p>\n<p>Other examples of making yourself publicly available are the personal analytics released by Stephen Wolfram [5], chief designer of Mathematica and Wolfram Alpha containing statistics of his Email traffic and keystrokes and the Application Programming Interface of @naveen [6] through which the web developer makes his self quantification freely usable.</p>\n<p>Being fascinated by computers for a long time, I also adore large amounts of data, but also acquired a sensitivity for privacy and what the structural inability of the Internet to forget. I can even remember persuading my friends and family to use encryption for Email - to no avail. \nOddly, out of the same direction arose the movement of the Internet of Things, short IoT, with the mission to develop autonomous but connected devices. Sharing the interest for new technologies, I got interested in finding out more about what the motivation and general outlook of this movement is, so I started joining a local group dedicated to this subject about two years ago and sporadically visited lectures and workshops. While these meetings were very interesting from a technological point of view, I still could not totally understand the dedications origin.\nFor an observation that was meant to build a foundation, I signed up\nfor an interesting excursion, a so called walkshop [7]. Basically, this was a guided walk through the city of Zurich with a strong focus on the numerous surveillance mechanisms, but also the simultaneous growing Internet connected devices, from the big advertisement displays installed in the main station hall to the numerous miscellaneous devices scattered around the city. Sadly, I had to leave early and missed the talks from the public transport department on how they measure passenger flow with connected devices and the security camera sniffing through the participants.\nBut nonetheless, it was really interesting to really perceive the amount of devices when looking up, especially on your everyday routes. Also, looking back with a definition of the artifacts based on Julian Bleecker instead of the more futuristic &quot;Spimes&quot; defined by Bruce Sterling, I finally began to understand the character and potential impact. </p>\n<p>What I observed in diving deeper into the subject, is that instead of traditional surveillance, the cliché of the twitter enabled refrigerator or the trending quantified self do not really match the nature. Bleecker talks defines the &quot;Things&quot; Blogjects, objects that blog. This means, they differentiate themselves from being a simple transmitter through the capability of having the motivation to enhance meaning through connectivity. Or, from a different point of view, an approach to make the public space more tangible, enabling it to speak for itself and evolve to a political issue out of it&#39;s own ability of articulation, eventually leading to the basics of that would enable the &quot;Dingpolitik&quot; envisioned by Latour and Weibel which I now begin to understand.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Things, once plugged into the Internet, will become agents that circulate food for thought, that “speak on” matters from an altogether different point of view, that lend a Thing-y perspective on micro and macro social, cultural, political and personal matters.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Julian Bleecker [8]</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, different than to what it appears at first, IoT is not about simply hooking up sensors to the consisting infrastructure, but more about building the foundation of an open (semantic) network that more or less leads to a new form of making space more tangible in different ways. The sensibility for privacy is more or less given, and the commitment to the open source community demand a different discussion than the general effects of public and private surveillance - for example in which way the conscious sharing of data contrasts the passive and uncertain accumulation and the associated adoption of power structures. But,  alongside the critical consideration of a differentiation of being <em>watched</em> and being <em>recorded</em>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"references-\">References:</h3>\n<p>1 <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore&#39;s_law\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore&#39;s_law</a><br>\n2 Fortune Magazine September 2012 according to WIRED.com<br>\n3 Foucault, Michel.

Ever since the television we are bound to glowing screens like moths, from gigantic CRT displays in the basement to the retina display in your pocket. Every new gadget comes with its own, new one. Hours and hours of work and resources spent on developing, designing, manufacturing – destined for en eternal existence on a landfill hopefully far away.</p>\n<p>Sure, some services live &quot;in the cloud&quot;, enabling the access from multiple devices for on service, but still require your full attention – from installation over login and usage to deletion.</p>\n<p>Nearly thirty years after the first screening of 2001: A Space Odyssey, Mark Weiser from Xerox PARC developed the idea of Ubiquitous Computing --- and the term Calm Technology. He argues that the perfect interface is an invisible one, and that the mentioned time that is spent on developing todays screen based interfaces is not at all leading into a desirable direction. Instead he says &quot;Attractiveness is the opposite of invisible&quot;.[1]\nThe idea there seems very appealing. A computer experience that is so subtle you forget it even exists. That really can&#39;t be said about the current state of technology. Blaring mobile devices that need and and sadly sometimes are given more attention than infants. Simultaneously, a mutated idea of ubiquitous computing called Internet of Things enables plants to use twitter and your body scale to post the state of your belly to your online profile. So does scientific progress, after all, really go &quot;boink&quot;?[3]</p>\n<p>Sadly, Mark Weiser passed away in 1999 and leaves behind the vision of calm technology. But Donald Norman and others keep on further refining the the outlines of a desirable future on living with the increasing number of digital devices. One key element is to break with the traditional display itself, or as Norman puts it: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;If I were to have my way, we would not see computer interfaces. In fact, we would not see computers: both the interface and the computer would be invisible, subservient to the task the person was attempting to accomplish.&quot;[8] </p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Or, more drastically, Weiser and Brown: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;If computers are everywhere they better stay out of the way.&quot;[2]</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But how is this goal achievable? One attempt was made by Rehman et al.[4] in 2000 where they experimented with augmented reality as substitute for the traditional display which certainly breaks with the traditional way,  but projecting the interface directly on your retina does not exactly count as being invisible. \nFurther approaches to calm technology, or ambient intelligence are scattered around in various areas. For example machine learning algorithms warning you of potential credit card fraud, netflix recommendation system, the predictive interface in Wolfram&#39;s Mathematica 9 and of course the Google PageRank algorithm. \nSpeaking of which, also developed Google Now, which is a relatively new service that goes into an interesting direction. </p>\n<h3 id=\"siriously-\">Siriously?</h3>\n<p>Google Now is, similar to Apples Siri, an interactive service for mobile devices, proclaiming to be an &quot;intelligent personal assistant&quot;. What it does is aiding the user in day to day activities with preprogrammed patterns like showing attractions near you, reminding you of calendar events, etc. It has not reached its full potential yet, as it will grow with the further development of Knowledge Graph.\nBut do these services match the criteria of calm technology? \nI would argue they do not. \nStarting with the failure of being subtle or even invisible. They both live on a device that has to be taken care of, have to be administered and can&#39;t be trusted in their current state. Furthermore they are neither intelligent nor a personal assistant.\nWhereas an intelligent system does not necessarily need an artificial consciousness, Google Now and Siri would need to adapt their behavior over time according to the fact that every user is an individual character with different needs that go far beyond finding a restaurant or setting timers. This adaption does not happen, but still both Apple and Google chose to use an anthropomorphic sonic interface that does not behave as the interface suggests. This becomes clear after a short time when the witty responses start to repeat. This is the ticket to a nice trip to the uncanny valley. Which is surprising, as many other companies learned to avoid this problem by using a metaphor, or more specifically zoomorphism, that does not suggest an equal counterpart like Sony&#39;s robotic pet Aibo or Toshiba&#39;s universal remote Apripoco. This briefly sums up the intelligence part.\nAs mentioned before, they both live on mobile devices exclusively, so the assistance stops working as soon as the user works on a different device like a workstation computer, the television, temperature regulation or lighting. This device (and display) agnosticism is a fundamental feature for a service that claims to be an assisting you. Another problem is that both services are by design not obedient to whomever they claim to assist. This obviously has to do with the limited featureset currently available, but also with a different topic named filter bubbling[5], which is a strategy to filter the content available to you on a basis you are not allowed to manipulate and certainly not your digital assistant programmed by the same company.</p>\n<h3 id=\"we-need-to-talk-\">We need to talk.</h3>\n<p>In the book &quot;Next Nature&quot;[6], the authors Koert van Mensvoort and Hendrik-Jan Grievink have made an adaption of Maslow&#39;s hierarchy of needs, which I show here in a condensed version. Currently, no digital invention arrived at the &quot;invisible&quot; layer, but it seems the internet is on its way from the vital layer to join omnipresent technologies like money and handwriting.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align:left\">Maslow&#39;s hierarchy of needs</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:left\">Hierarchy of Technology</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">-</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">(Natural)*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Self-transcendence</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Invisible</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Self-actualization</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Vital</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Esteem</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Accepted</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Safety needs</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Applied</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Physiological needs</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Functional</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><sub><em>* In brackets, as the book narrows technology not only to digital artifacts. If digital artifacts hold the potential to become a naturalized technology as agriculture, cooking or time is a question that would go beyond the scope of this essay.</em></sub></p>\n<p>In the same book, Joran Damsteeg et al. have devised 11 Golden Rules of Anthropomorphism and Product Design[7]. A few have been addressed before, but I will quote them in their entirety and add more points that deem fundamental for a calmer execution of personal assistants.</p>\n<p><strong>11 Golden Rules:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Any Association that Can be Made, Will be Made</li>\n<li>Different People Anthropomorphize Differently</li>\n<li>Keep it ASS. Abstract, Simple and Subtle</li>\n<li>Complex Products Tend to Be Anthropomorphized</li>\n<li>Consider Zoomorphism as an Alternative</li>\n<li>Meet People’s Expectations</li>\n<li>Respect Social Standards</li>\n<li>Use Human Ethics</li>\n<li>Be Aware of the Ecosystem You’re Invading</li>\n<li>Enhance Human Experience, Don’t Replace It</li>\n<li>Don’t Use Anthropomorphism if it Does Not Serve Any Purpose</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Additional principles:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Exceptional Natural language processing (sarcasm, seriousness)</li>\n<li>Ambient intelligence (IoT interface)</li>\n<li>Device agnosticism</li>\n<li>User always has override</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The first point mentions the human voice as as interface. This is not only a remnant of looking into Google Now and Siri. Altough Weiser said that even if it technically works, it would still be a conscious interaction and far from unobtrusive. \nHe also holds this up against intelligent agents, as the relationship would put it too much in the center of attention[1]. </p>\n<p>But still, I would argue this combination is the most precise and natural interface imaginable in the near future and reduces the time needed to concentrate to a minimum. Even a thought controlled interaction is still a conscious interaction by definition. Maybe my sight is too narrow here, but I can not imagine a more reduced interface than that. There only stays a solely autonomous system that we are not capable to interact with anymore. Furthermore, as anthropomorphobic reactions are lost over time, a voice based solution could be easier to adapt to than any visual representation. </p>\n<p>The fourth point refers to the filter bubbles, which means the user should have the choice to bypass preprogrammed patterns when the situation demands it. Apart from that, the modulation of the input should influence the action and enable tasks being executed based on a calculated priority. This is not only applicable to voice input, as an example from the movie Johnny Mnemonic shows. When the character Takahashi ends a call, he does this with a wide sweeping arm gesture that leads to an ending of the call, but also to the retraction of the video phone into his desk. In the book &quot;Make it so --- Interaction Design Lessons from Science Fiction&quot; the authors Nathan Shedroff and Christopher Noessel add to this scene:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;When technology allows for a range of inputs, users can channel emotion into them, making the input more than a control but also a medium of expression. If the degree of emotion affects the degree of system response, all the better. This means that the technology fits the way we communicate as people much more readily than the precision that best fits computers.&quot;[9]</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>&quot;I don&#39;t understand this &#39;ass kicking&#39; reference, sir.&quot;</strong></p>\n<p>Sadly, I am not aware of an existing system that matches these criterias, so once again Science Fiction has to serve as an example. \nOne system, despite the added eye candy for entertainment, ticks off a lot of the points above and it is: J.A.R.V.I.S. from the newer Iron Man movie adaptations[10]. Originally a butler in the comic books, the film turned the character into a sophisticated intelligent assistant. It is device agnostic, as it lives in Tony Starks workshop, mobile devices and suits. It is also display agnostic and adapts the method to the intended usage (screen based, volumetric projection, voice only). J.A.R.V.I.S. also understands sarcasm and accepts overrides –– despite not being able to understand the logic or knowing it is mathematically impossible, which also makes sense metaphorically since the relationship emulates a master / butler affiliation.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;Jarvis, remind me to develop a personality for you later.&quot;\n<br>Tony Stark[11]</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"references-\">References:</h3>\n<p>1 <a href=\"http://project.cyberpunk.ru/idb/ubicomp_world_is_not_desktop.html\">http://project.cyberpunk.ru/idb/ubicomp_world_is_not_desktop.html</a><br>\n2 <a href=\"http://www.johnseelybrown.com/calmtech.pdf\">http://www.johnseelybrown.com/calmtech.pdf</a><br>\n3 <a href=\"http://cdn0.sbnation.com/imported_assets/1025866/jon3_GIF.gif\">http://cdn0.sbnation.com/imported_assets/1025866/jon3_GIF.gif</a><br>\n4 <a href=\"http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/dtg/www/files/publications/public/fms27/2002-RehmanStaCou-invisible.pdf\">http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/dtg/www/files/publications/public/fms27/2002-RehmanStaCou-invisible.pdf</a><br>\n5 <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/eli_pariser_beware_online_filter_bubbles.html\">http://www.ted.com/talks/eli_pariser_beware_online_filter_bubbles.html</a><br>\n6  Koert van Mensvoort, Hendrik-Jan Grievink &quot;Next Nature&quot;, Actar 2011, p.378-387<br>\n7  ibid., p.378-387<br>\n8 Norman, Donald A.: &quot;Why Interfaces Don&#39;t Work&quot; in Laurel, Brenda (ed.): The Art of HumanComputer Interface Design, Addison-Wesley, 1990, p.219<br>\n9  Nathan Shedroff and Christopher Noessel: &quot;Make it so --- Interaction Design Lessons from Science Fiction&quot;, Rosenfeld Media 2012, p.214<br>\n10 <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbj3XSvDyw8\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbj3XSvDyw8</a><br>\n11 <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1233205/\">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1233205/</a><br></p>\n"},{"title":"medusae","date":2015,"path":"img/medusae/","background":"cover.jpg","images":["01.jpg","02.jpg","03.jpg","04.jpg","cover.jpg"],"meta":[{"collaboration with":"<a href=\"http://www.meret.com/\">Meret Vollenweider</a><a href=\"http://people.zhdk.ch/jessica.steinmitz/Jessica_Steinmitz.html\">Jessica Steinmitz</a><a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/pub/maria-antonieta-diaz-alfaro/27/3a5/251\">Maria Antonieta Diaz Alfaro</a>"}],"tags":["installation concept","interaction design","interaction","ai","ixd","arduino","physical computing","electronics"],"_url":"/projects/medusae.html","content":"<p>Medusae is an abstracted voting system suited to the upcoming relocation of the Zurich University of the Arts from scattered faculties to one unifying building. \nThe medusae are artificial organisms which live in the entrance hall and can be either interacted with or just act as a vague display of previous interactions. </p>\n<p>Medusae is a project born in an interactive architecture workshop particularly with regard to the relocation from the Zurich University of the Arts to the unified \n“Toni Areal”.

The data is fetched from wordbank.org\nand lets you compare the population distribution, access to clean drinking water, Internet availability and the role of mineral deposits in the countries GDP.</p>\n<p>Soils displays various datasets on two separate three-dimensional bars which the user can rotate to compare two countries in an explorative way. The countries can be chosen through two input fields with advanced auto-complete functionality from the <a href=\"http://baymard.com/labs/country-selector\">Baymard Institute</a>. It handles typos, multiple spelling sequences, synonyms and prioritization and therefore was preferred by me over a navigation through country outlines.\nOnce two countries are chosen, the data is fetched via an API Call\nfrom <a href=\"http://www.worldbank.org\">worldbank.org</a> and is immediately represented on the two bars. On the top, skyscrapers represent the amount people living in an urban surrounding whereas the small houses represent the rural area.\nOn the front, the bright blue water represents the amount of the population with access to clean drinking water. So when the water is half dirty, only fifty percent have access to drinking water.\nOn the bottom, you can see the availability of Internet for the population.\nOn the backside, the amount of crystals represents the role of mineral deposits in the countries GDP. This means, it does not show how big the countries deposits are (which would be a bland information without knowledge of the countries size and the specific resource) but how much the country is dependent on trading with them compared to other branches of economy.\nAdditionally, there is an info Layer which primarily guides new users through the different aspects of the application. Once the countries have been chosen, more accurate data is added to this view and can be consulted as needed. \nIt is built mainly with the WebGL library <a href=\"http://threejs.org\">three.js</a> and is rendered on the client side.</p>\n"},{"title":"spatial","date":2013,"path":"img/spatial/","background":"cover2.png","hero":"","images":["01.jpg","02.jpg","03.jpg","04.jpg","05.jpg","06.png"],"meta":[{"achievement unlocked":"code right hand out of servo motor"}],"tags":["physical computing","interaction design","ixd","kinect","electronics","robotics","dynamixel","camera vision","processing","spatial"],"_url":"/projects/spatial.html","content":"<p>In this collaborative project, <a href=\"http://www.trick-mueller.ch/\">Patrick Müller</a> and I were interested in the confrontation with an \nunknown thing, where the situation defined the space.
