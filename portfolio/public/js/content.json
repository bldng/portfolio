One of many ideas was a voting system for the new campus that enables students to articulate their feelings towards topics primarily related to \nadministrative topics, but also as a tool for the university management to better understand and evaluate tendencies and opinions. \nThe primary focus was on keeping the interaction fun and the experience far away from the previous methods like email surveys, resulting in the dropping of \npossible questions that require user authentication. After a testing phase based on throwies and reactive surfaces, the interface was changed due to problems \nkeeping the electronic reliable and the poor usage of the available space. Thus, the idea of the medusae was born. Instead of using a static object as input area, \nthe medusae are floating blimps resembling jellyfish that react to their specific nourishment. Depending on which colored light source is chosen, the corresponding \nartificial organism approaches it and starts consuming the light, resulting in brighter lighting patterns and a more dynamic behavior and movement. This reaction \nenables to read the mood of the campus related to one issue by just looking up and judging the state of the different colored medusae. </p>\n"},{"title":"ntt","date":2014,"path":"img/ntt/","background":"cover.png","hero":"<video controls src=\"http://cl.ly/1d1g3d0K2U32/export.mov\" style=\"width:100%;\" poster=\"/img/ntt/video.png\"></video>","images":["01.jpg","02.jpg","03.jpg","04.jpg","05.jpg","06.png","07.png","08.jpg"],"meta":[{"github":"<a href=\"https://github.com/bldng/ntt\" target=\"_blank\">github.com/bldng/ntt</a>"},{"thesis":"<a href=\"http://cl.ly/2R0Q0v111T35/thesis_gerhard_bliedung.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">link</a>"},{"documentation":"<a href=\"http://cl.ly/393Q2T1v2K11/documentation_gerhard_bliedung.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">link</a>"}],"tags":["interaction design","interaction","ixd","ai","webgl","camera vision"],"_url":"/projects/ntt.html","content":"<p>Bachelor thesis, Zurich Univerity of the Arts.</p>\n<p>ntt — Embracing reciprocity in ubiquitous computing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"motivation\">Motivation</h2>\n<p>While technology advances rapidly and simultaneously enters personal space, our relationship \nwith these artifacts seems to evolve at a different pace.

The countries can be chosen through two input fields with advanced auto-complete functionality from the <a href=\"http://baymard.com/labs/country-selector\">Baymard Institute</a>. It handles typos, multiple spelling sequences, synonyms and prioritization and therefore was preferred by me over a navigation through country outlines.\nOnce two countries are chosen, the data is fetched via an API Call\nfrom <a href=\"http://www.worldbank.org\">worldbank.org</a> and is immediately represented on the two bars. On the top, skyscrapers represent the amount people living in an urban surrounding whereas the small houses represent the rural area.\nOn the front, the bright blue water represents the amount of the population with access to clean drinking water. So when the water is half dirty, only fifty percent have access to drinking water.\nOn the bottom, you can see the availability of Internet for the population.\nOn the backside, the amount of crystals represents the role of mineral deposits in the countries GDP. This means, it does not show how big the countries deposits are (which would be a bland information without knowledge of the countries size and the specific resource) but how much the country is dependent on trading with them compared to other branches of economy.\nAdditionally, there is an info Layer which primarily guides new users through the different aspects of the application. Once the countries have been chosen, more accurate data is added to this view and can be consulted as needed. \nIt is built mainly with the WebGL library <a href=\"http://threejs.org\">three.js</a> and is rendered on the client side.</p>\n"},{"title":"spatial","date":2013,"path":"img/spatial/","background":"cover2.png","hero":"","images":["01.jpg","02.jpg","03.jpg","04.jpg","05.jpg","06.png"],"meta":[{"achievement unlocked":"code right hand out of servo motor"}],"tags":["interaction design","ixd","kinect","physical computing","electronics","robotics","dynamixel","camera vision","processing"],"_url":"/projects/spatial.html","content":"<p>In this collaborative project, <a href=\"http://www.trick-mueller.ch/\">Patrick Müller</a> and I were interested in the confrontation with an \nunknown thing, where the situation defined the space.
